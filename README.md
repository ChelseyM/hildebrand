# hildebrand [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nervous-systems/hildebrand.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nervous-systems/hildebrand)

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/io.nervous/hildebrand/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/io.nervous/hildebrand)

Undocumented, high-level, pure Clojure asynchronous AWS client, built on top of [eulalie](https://github.com/nervous-systems/eulalie).

Hildebrand has successfully been used in production, and is extremely [well tested](https://github.com/nervous-systems/hildebrand/blob/master/test/hildebrand_test.clj).

[This blog post]( https://nervous.io/clojure/aws/dynamo/hildebrand/2015/06/08/hildebrand/) has a bunch of usage examples in it.

[Contributions welcomed!](https://github.com/nervous-systems/hildebrand/issues)
