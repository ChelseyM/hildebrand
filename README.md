High-level, asynchronous Dynamo client, built on top of [eulalie](https://github.com/nervous-systems/eulalie).

Hildebrand has successfully been used in production, and is extremely well tested.

[This blog post]( https://nervous.io/clojure/aws/dynamo/hildebrand/2015/06/08/hildebrand/) has a bunch of usage examples in it.

[Contributions welcomed!](https://github.com/nervous-systems/hildebrand/issues)
